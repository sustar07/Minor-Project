# WRAMP - Wireless Remote Attack and Monitoring Platform

WRAMP (Wireless Remote Attack and Monitoring Platform) is a portable, low-power, remotely accessible cyberattack and surveillance toolkit designed for red teaming, penetration testing, and field monitoring. It integrates wireless network scanning, attack execution, remote shell access, and update capabilities into a compact hardware setup built on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

## üß† Project Summary

WRAMP is a **proof-of-concept offensive security device** capable of:

- Scanning and identifying wireless devices in range
- Monitoring and logging traffic and OS fingerprints
- Executing modular wireless attacks
- Triggering XSS payloads via captive portal redirection
- Accessing a live shell remotely via LTE
- Self-updating and loading new payloads remotely

All this is done using **Python scripts**, **Linux networking tools**, and **lightweight hardware**, making WRAMP suitable for discreet field deployments and offensive cyber-experiments.
